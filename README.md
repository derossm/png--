# png++

The project wasn't on GitHub and doesn't seem to have been updated in a while, so I'm just basically adding constexpr to all the things.

I'm also going to give it a pass towards Core Guidelines compliance.

I need to write a test suit first to make sure things haven't already broken horribly.
